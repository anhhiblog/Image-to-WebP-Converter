# Image to WebP Converter
Converting images to WebP format can be very efficient in terms of file size reduction. Here's a breakdown of the benefits:

* Smaller file sizes: Compared to JPEGs, WebP offers an average of 25-34% smaller file size while maintaining similar visual quality. This translates to faster loading times for web pages.

* Lossless and lossy options: WebP provides both lossless and lossy compression modes. Lossless compression keeps the image quality intact but offers slightly less reduction compared to lossy. Lossy allows for even smaller file sizes, but with a potential for some quality loss (similar to JPEGs).
